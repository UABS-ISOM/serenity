YOUNG MAN
No, forget it, it's too risky. 
I'm through doin' that shit.

YOUNG WOMAN
You always say that, the same thing every time: never again, I'm through, too dangerous.

YOUNG MAN
I know that's what I always say. 
I'm always right too, but

YOUNG WOMAN
but you forget about it in a day or two -

YOUNG MAN
yeah, well, the days of me forgittin' are over, and the days of me rememberin' have just begun.

YOUNG WOMAN
When you go on like this, you know what you sound like?

YOUNG MAN
I sound like a sensible fucking man, is what I sound like.

YOUNG WOMAN
You sound like a duck. 
Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack...

YOUNG MAN
Well take heart, 'cause you're never gonna hafta hear it again. 
Because since I'm never gonna do it again, you're never gonna hafta hear me quack about how I'm never gonna do it again.

YOUNG WOMAN
After tonight.

YOUNG MAN
Correct. 
I got all tonight to quack.

YOUNG MAN
I mean the way it is now, you're takin' the same fuckin' risk as when you rob a bank. 
You take more of a risk. 
Banks are easier!  
Federal banks aren't supposed to stop you anyway, during a robbery. 
They're insured, why should they care? 
You don't even need a gun in a federal bank. 
I heard about this guy, walked into a federal bank with a portable phone, handed the phone to the teller, the guy on the other end of the phone said: "We got this guy's little girl, and if you don't give him all your money, we're gonna kill 'er."

YOUNG WOMAN
Did it work?

YOUNG MAN
Fuckin' A it worked, that's what I'm talkin' about! 
Knucklehead walks in a bank with a telephone, not a pistol, not a shotgun, but a fuckin' phone, cleans the place out, and they don't lift a fuckin' finger.

YOUNG WOMAN
Did they hurt the little girl?

YOUNG MAN
I don't know. 
There probably never was a little girl – the point of the story isn't the little girl. 
The point of the story is they robbed the bank with a telephone.

YOUNG WOMAN
You wanna rob banks?

YOUNG MAN
I'm not sayin' I wanna rob banks, I'm just illustrating that if we did, it would be easier than what we been doin'.

YOUNG WOMAN
So you don't want to be a bank robber?

YOUNG MAN
Naw, all those guys are goin' down the same road, either dead or servin' twenty.

YOUNG WOMAN
And no more liquor stores?

YOUNG MAN
What have we been talking about? 
Yeah, no more-liquor-stores. 
Besides, it ain't the giggle it usta be. 
Too many foreigners own liquor stores. 
Vietnamese, Koreans, they can't fuckin' speak English. 
You tell 'em: "Empty out the register," and they don't know what it fuckin' means. 
They make it too personal. 
We keep on, one of those gook motherfuckers' gonna make us kill 'em.

YOUNG WOMAN
I'm not gonna kill anybody.

YOUNG MAN
I don't wanna kill anybody either. 
But they'll probably put us in a situation where it's us of them. 
And if it's not the gooks, it these old Jews who've owned the store for fifteen fuckin' generations. 
Ya got Grandpa Irving sittin' behind the counter with a fuckin' Magnum. 
Try walkin' into one of those stores with nothin' but a telephone, see how far it gets you. 
Fuck it, forget it, we're out of it.

YOUNG WOMAN
Well, what else is there, day jobs?

YOUNG MAN
Not this life.

YOUNG WOMAN
Well what then?

YOUNG MAN
This place.

YOUNG WOMAN
Here? It's a coffee shop.

YOUNG MAN
What's wrong with that? 
People never rob restaurants, why not? 
Bars, liquor stores, gas stations, you get your head blown off stickin' up one of them. 
Restaurants, on the other hand, you catch with their pants down. 
They're not expecting to get robbed, or not as expecting.

YOUNG WOMAN
I bet in places like this you could cut down on the hero factor.

YOUNG MAN
Correct. 
Just like banks, these places are insured. 
The managers don't give a fuck, they're just tryin' to get ya out the door before you start pluggin' diners.  
Waitresses, forget it, they ain't takin' a bullet for the register. 
Busboys, some wetback gettin' paid a dollar fifty a hour gonna really give a fuck you're stealin' from the owner. 
Customers are sittin' there with food in their mouths, they don't know what's goin' on. 
One minute they're havin' a Denver omelet, next minute somebody's stickin' a gun in their face.

YOUNG MAN
See, I got the idea last liquor store we stuck up. 
'Member all those customers kept comin' in?

YOUNG WOMAN
Yeah.

YOUNG MAN
Then you got the idea to take everybody's wallet.

YOUNG WOMAN
Uh-huh.

YOUNG MAN
That was a good idea.

YOUNG WOMAN
Thanks.

YOUNG MAN
We made more from the wallets then we did the register.

YOUNG WOMAN
Yes we did.

YOUNG MAN
A lot of people go to restaurants.

YOUNG WOMAN
A lot of wallets.

YOUNG MAN
Pretty smart, huh?

YOUNG WOMAN
Pretty smart.
I'm ready, let's go, right here, right now.

YOUNG MAN
Remember, same as before, you're crowd control, I handle the employees.

YOUNG WOMAN
Got it.

YOUNG WOMAN
I love you, Pumpkin.

YOUNG MAN
I love you, Honey Bunny.
